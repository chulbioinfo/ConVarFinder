# Overview
This script to run convergent variant finder (ConVarFinder) analysis to idenify convergent single sequence variants of target species which share a convergent trait you are interested in. Based on this script and demo data, you can find ConSAVs of avian vocal learners mutually exclusive to amino acids of vocal non-learners.
## Input Files
It needs multiple peptide sequence aglinments as input files (as [fasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) format).
## Variables in Script
-l=    strings of list of target species as comma seperated (csv)

-ttf=  input file of templete tree

-tfmt= file format of binary tree with ancestral nodes

-sfmt= file format of input with ancestral reconstructions

-ip=   input path

-op=   output path  

## Output Files
It generates a text file (.txt) as a output with a summary of ConVarFinder analysis and the full amino acids of whole species list at identified sites with convergent Variants.
